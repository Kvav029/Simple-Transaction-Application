# Simple-Transaction-Application
Written in a single C# file, this console application contains basic features such as 
deposit, withdraw, balance checks, and more. This is only a side project that is done 
to improve my skills in C# and the .NET framework. Instructions to execute functions 
in the program are pretty straight forward if you wish to try it out for yourself.

There are plenty of projects like this that are easily done out there, so don't think 
doing something like this is too difficult to make. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
